# Architecture:
Create a multimodal neural network that uses feature vectors obtained using both RNN and CNN, so consequently, two inputs have to be taken.
One is the image we need to describe, a feed to the CNN, and the second is the words in the text sequence produced till now as a sequence as the input to the RNN.
